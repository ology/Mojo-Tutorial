"Meditate on these (following) things:"

* M.V.C. = Model / View / Controller

    - An application is a living thing with (at least) three layers:

Bones = Database
Flesh = Templates
Meat = Code

Model = Database
View = Templates
Controller = Code

Back-end (model),
Front-end (view),
Middle! (controller)

"I would keep a notes file with those things in it. And anything else you want to remember."
"So we have 3 interpretations of the 3 layers of an application."
"So lets think about some applications in the wild. Say Facebook."
"The database is the stuff in everyone's profiles."
"The templates are the things that make the layout of an actual page - colors, borders, etc."
"The code is the stuff you can't see that links the database and the templates to render someone's profile."
